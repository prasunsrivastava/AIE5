1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
   - Aspect Tested: Clarity and simplicity
   - Vibe - **To me, if I were a beginner, it did not make sense at all. The answer was still geared towards
     maybe a junior developer rather than a complete beginner. It kept using jargons like inheritance and polymorphism
     which do not make sense to me as a complete beginner. This was a fail for me.**
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points.
   We train modern Machine Learning models (since 2012, these are typically “Deep”, i.e. very large, and always getting larger!) with some human interpretable goal. For example, we may want a Face Recognition Model to correctly identify employees of a business entering the premises with 99% accuracy. How do we train a model to achieve this? In ML land, we use an objective function, or “loss” to steer our initial (bad) model to update itself iteratively and hopefully do slightly better each time until we hit the 99% accuracy we require.
   - Aspect Tested: Summarization
   - Vibe - **It did kind of okay on the summarization. However, the text that I used was still pretty small paragraph. I should
     have used a more complicated and larger body of text.**
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
   - Aspect Tested: Creativity
   - Vibe - **The LLM performed well on the creativity here. It was able to write a good short story.**
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
   - Aspect Tested: Reasoning
   - Vibe: **LLM was able to answer the question correctly by reasoning through it step by step.**
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone.
   You know, we’ve been using those fancy language models, LLMs, in the office lately, and honestly, they’re kinda amazing! It’s like having this super-smart assistant who’s always ready to help. Need an email written? Done. Stuck on how to word something? Boom, suggestions galore. It even helps with boring stuff like organizing data or pulling insights—it’s like magic. And the best part? It’s actually helping us think outside the box. Like, sometimes we’ll throw in some wild ideas, and the LLM will spit back something even cooler. It’s like having that one friend who always knows the answer but doesn’t make you feel dumb about it. Honestly, it’s made things so much smoother and more fun. We’re loving it!
   - Aspect Tested: Appropriateness of tone & Formality
   - Vibe - **The LLM nailed this one. It was perfect for an office setting according to me.**
