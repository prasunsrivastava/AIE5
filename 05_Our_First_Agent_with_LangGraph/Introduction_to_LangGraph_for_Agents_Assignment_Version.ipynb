    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "\n",
    "Earlier we used this phrasing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We initialize our state object:\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : []}`\n",
    "2. Our user submits a query to our application.\n",
    "  - New State: `HumanMessage(#1)`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1)}`\n",
    "3. We pass our state object to an Agent node which is able to read the current state. It will use the last `HumanMessage` as input. It gets some kind of output which it will add to the state.\n",
    "  - New State: `AgentMessage(#1, additional_kwargs {\"function_call\" : \"WebSearchTool\"})`\n",
    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

       "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based and generation-based methods to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text. Here's how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, relevant information is retrieved from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that searches for documents or passages that are most relevant to the input query or context.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input. This means that the retrieved data is combined with the original input to provide more context or background information.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generation model, often based on a neural network like a transformer, uses the augmented input to generate a response or output. The generation model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant text because it has access to additional information retrieved in the first step.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in applications like question answering, where the system needs to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers by leveraging both stored knowledge and the ability to generate natural language responses.\""

      "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses. It involves creating input, instructional, and conversational prompts to minimize bias and improve the quality of AI outputs. This technique is crucial in various applications, including customer support, content generation, and data analysis. Prompt engineering is an iterative process that may require repeated prompting to achieve the desired results, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and cost savings ([Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/prompt-engineering), [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/prompt-engineering)).\n",

      "**History of Prompt Engineering**\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of prompt engineering can be traced back to the early days of code generation tools like CodeSmith and MyGeneration, which automated the generation of boilerplate code for common programming tasks. Over time, prompt engineering evolved with advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning techniques. These developments have enhanced the capabilities of language models, making them more powerful, context-aware, and adaptable for a wide range of NLP applications. The introduction of attention mechanisms and reinforcement learning in 2017 further improved the controllability of prompt-engineered language models, allowing engineers to shape model behavior and address biases ([Promptly Substack](https://promptly.substack.com/p/a-journey-through-the-history-of), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04438)).\n",

      "RAG was first proposed in 2020, making it a relatively new technology. Since its inception, it has gained popularity due to its ability to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks. The technology has evolved to include advanced retrievers and complementary technologies, leading to more complex RAG systems. Recent research has focused on modular RAG frameworks, which decompose complex systems into independent modules, allowing for a more reconfigurable and efficient design.\n",
